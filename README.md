# Selective-analyses-of-areas-of-interest-for-next-generation-sequencing
This script is used to compare NGS reads to a given reference for only in areas of interest. In other words, the script only compares the sequence in a location where you expect a difference to be. It currently does so for up to five different locations. The outputs is generated for each given location of interest (if less than five the last files will be empty) as less_than (fewer mismatches in allignment than the reference (insertion)) more_than (more mismatches than reference (deletion)) and different_in_sequence (general difference in sequence).
